# Car-Plate-Recognition-svm
This was my final year project at University Constantine 2 in Algeria. Its primary purpose was to detect and process digits on Algerian car plate numbers using MATLAB and machine learning techniques, specifically Support Vector Machines (SVM).

My PFE (Projet de fin d'Ã©tudes in French) was a modest initial attempt in the realm of machine learning, notwithstanding the limited resources available.
